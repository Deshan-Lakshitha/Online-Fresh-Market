# Online-Fresh-Market
 
This repository contains our 3rd semester group project "Online Fresh Market" which is an online shopping platform.

With the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation of the country, it has become very risky to go outside and buy the things you need or do shopping activities. It is one of the major way of spreading the virus among the community. As a timely solution for this problem we introduce “Online Fresh Market” system which is a home delivery system where you can order the agricultural products like vegetables and fruits to your doorsteps.
